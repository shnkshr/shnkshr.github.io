        <p class="lead">This webpage contains information for a game engine we created as a part of the course CS
            4850/5850 Building Game Engines.</p>
        <h3>Wow Factor</h3>
        <ul>
            <!-- <li>Double Jump!

            <li>Checkpoints - don't let your progress go in vain!

            <li>Multiple enemy types!
            </li> -->
            <p>Our Engine focuses more on the APIs rather that the tile editor because we wanted to make our engine as generic as possible. As a result we were able to create a variety of 2D games - like platformers & arcade games as shown below. 
                 
                We also used Box2D to handle physics throughout our system and provided a clean abstraction over our APIs to use Physics in the game - All the user needs to do is configure & attach the Physics component on an object and the object moves according to the laws of physics and computations done based on the configuration.
                The Engine takes care of creating a physics body that automatically performs updates, collisions etc on every frame. All the user has to do is attach the game object like pacman to it.

                <br>
                Our editor also comes with useful features to make game development easier. 
                
                Some of these include : <br> <br>
                <li>Functionality of load/save project so that the user can continue working on a project.</li> 
                <li>A status panel at the bottom that tells the user about the status of the game configuration.</li> 
                <li>Functionality to add any property to a given game object which can be used in the python scripts.</li> 
            </p>

        <h3>Post Mortem</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Editor
                <p>
                    Currently, the preview window can be used to preview a game object when loaded with a custom sprite. But due to time constraint
                    we could not implement relativ positioning of these objects that will be rendered in the game.
                    We could add this functrionality of being able to drag and rop game objects and tiles in respective positions such that
                    the same layout will be rendered in the game.
                </p>

            <li>Menu
                <p>
                    Currently, our game engine doesn't support a menu component. So user needs to achieve it using existing components manually,
                     which is a hard work. We could add a menu component to let user create menu easier.
                </p>
            <li>Game object AI
                <p>
                    Our game engine doesn't support AI, so users need to create it by themselves. We can improved it by supporting some default behaviors of AI.
                </p>
            <li>Physics
                <p>
                    Although we use Box2D to handle the collision and gravity, we can improve the behavior of 
                    physics by solving the problem where objects in the game might stick at somewhere. 
                    Also the physics properties of objects are limited due to Box2D. 
                    For example, an object can not pass through another object and raise contact callback without collision.
                </p>
            <li>Different Tile properties
                <p>
                    For now, tiles have same properties. We could let user to add custom properties to the tile, 
                    for instance, different tiles have different friction, or some tiles could be destroyed by player.
                </p>
        </ul>

        <h3>Instructions: using the Game Engine (Linux ONLY)</h3><br>
        <h4> Instructions to run the game Engine:</h4> <br>
        <p>
            Make sure that you have python3.8 installed in your linux machine.
            cd into the project root folder. 
            Run the build files linuxpybindbuild.py and tileeditorbuild.py using the commands: <br>
            python3 linuxpybindbuild.py <br>
            python3 tileeditorbuild.py <br>

            Once the files are built, you can run the game engine using <br>
            python3 engineeditor.py

            For detailed instructions on how to create Game objects and adding python scripts, please refer to the "Trailer" video above.
        </p> <br>
        <h4> Instructions to run the tile editor:</h4><br>
        <p>The tile editor has two options PNG and BMP
            For PNG, the best results are achieved when the tiles are provided as individual png tiles and they are
            rendered at their original resoultion. The tile editor
            can scroll infinitely so this the dimensions are not an issue.
            In case of PNG, the names of the tiles should be numbers in increasing order like 0.png, 1.png, etc. You can
            see such a sample in Assets folder.
            To create a tile map, you simply need to enter these names seperated by a single whitespace. If the format
            is incorrect tiles will not be render. You can click the "Update Config" button to see if what you have
            entered is valid or not.</p>
